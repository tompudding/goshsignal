The signal was discovered on the night of August 15th 2013 at 23:15, with the dish pointed at right ascencion 19h28m10s and declination 26 degrees 55 minutes. The dish has been pointing there ever since, though we're still receiving too much noise.

We've finally cleared the dirt from the dish and gotten a good look at the signal.It repeats reliably every 10 seconds. Dr Ehman has found an excellent candidate for the carrier wave that gives perfect signal reconstruction but we're at a loss to explain it. We have confirmed that the origin is extra terrestrial.
